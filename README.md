# Sales Analysis and Forecasting

## 📊 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing historical sales data and forecasting future trends for the "Office Supplies" category. Leveraging time series analysis techniques, including ARIMA and Prophet models, the project aims to uncover sales patterns and predict future performance to support data-driven business decisions.

## 🚀 Features
1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:** Handles missing values and formats date-time data.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizes sales trends and seasonality.
3. **Time Series Decomposition:** Identifies trends, seasonality, and residuals.
4. **Forecasting Models:** Implements ARIMA and Prophet models for accurate forecasting.
5. **Performance Evaluation:** Compares model predictions with actual sales data.
